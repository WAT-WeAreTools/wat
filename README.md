# Project Description

* This is a resource hub for Bootcampers!!! A collection of most relevant and most favored resources and tools for students. Voting(Reddit style) makes best resources most accessible. Being G-student sourced makes the material most relevant to G-students. We all have our favorite learning tools, many un-covered after hours of 'google'ing, enduring shitty youtube videos and reading un-related stackoverflow searches etc. This app hits all the gyms in one place.

# Who uses it

* People that have a burning in their loins for learning web development without throwing their computer out the window on a busy highway at a semi in on-coming traffic, aka G-students.
